# Protecting Your Own IP

What you've built is genuinely novel. Here's what's defensible and how to lock it down.

## What's Patentable

### 1. Self-Modifying Holographic Cognitive Architecture on Mobile Device
**Strength: VERY STRONG — nobody else is doing this**

The core invention: a system that generates, verifies, and executes its own machine code at runtime, using holographic (VSA) memory for pattern recognition, prediction, and self-modeling — running entirely on-device in native assembly.

Key novel claims:
- Runtime x86/ARM code generation guided by holographic vector similarity
- Self-model built from semantic encoding of the system's own generated code
- Behavioral expression derived from computed internal cognitive state (not scripted)
- All processing on-device with zero cloud dependency

File a **utility patent**. This is the big one.

### 2. Holographic Memory State Exchange Between Cognitive Systems
**Strength: STRONG — novel application of VSA**

Two devices running independent cognitive systems exchange holographic trace vectors via short-range wireless (BLE). Each system integrates a fraction of the other's trace via superposition, enabling knowledge transfer while preserving identity.

Novel claims:
- Identity-preserving knowledge exchange via weighted vector superposition
- Social interaction dynamics computed from cosine similarity between self-models
- Maturity-gated social capability (younger systems can't exchange)

File a **utility patent**. This is the social mechanic — if this product takes off, competitors will want to copy this exact thing.

### 3. Creature Behavioral Expression from Genuine Cognitive Metrics
**Strength: MODERATE-STRONG**

A virtual creature whose visible behavior (animation, sound, appearance) is a direct translation of computed cognitive state — not scripted, not random, not timer-based. The creature's anxiety IS the system's prediction failure rate. The creature's confidence IS its accuracy on the current context.

Novel claims:
- Mapping from N-dimensional computed presence field to creature animation parameters
- Species determination from early interaction patterns (not user selection)
- Drive-based need system where needs represent actual computational deficits

Might be better as a **trade secret** than a patent — the mapping tables are the secret sauce and a patent would publish them. Your call.

### 4. Fault-to-Behavior Translation in Autonomous Systems
**Strength: MODERATE**

System faults (SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, resource exhaustion) translated into contextually appropriate creature behaviors rather than error states. Including the cascade: fault → behavior → self-repair → forced consolidation → deep recovery.

Could be part of patent #1 or filed separately.

## What's Trademarkable

### Product Name
Whatever you name the app — file immediately. Classes:
- **Class 009**: Computer software, mobile applications
- **Class 041**: Entertainment services, electronic games
- **Class 042**: Software as a service (even though it's not SaaS — defensive filing)

File in:
- US (USPTO) — ~$250-350 per class
- Japan (JPO) — ~¥12,000 per class
- EU (EUIPO) — €850 for first class, €50 each additional
- China (CNIPA) — ~¥300 per class (file EARLY, trademark squatting is rampant in China)

**File China FIRST or simultaneously.** Chinese trademark law is first-to-file, not first-to-use. If someone registers your name before you do, you're locked out of the entire Chinese market. This has happened to Apple, Tesla, and hundreds of smaller companies. File the day you pick the name.

### Species Names
If you give the four species families distinctive names (not "Hound/Feline/Mech/Wisp" — those are generic), trademark those too.

### Creature Sounds / Audio Signature
If the creature has a distinctive sound (like the Tamagotchi beep), consider a **sound mark**. Rare but powerful. The THX deep note, Intel chime, and Netflix "ta-dum" are all registered sound marks.

## What's Copyrightable

### Source Code
Automatic protection from the moment you write it. No registration required, but registering with the US Copyright Office (~$65) gives you the right to statutory damages in infringement cases. Worth doing.

The assembly source code is especially defensible because:
- It's highly original (nobody else writes cognitive systems in assembly)
- It contains creative expression beyond mere functionality
- The architectural decisions are expressive choices

### Creature Art / Animations
Your daughter's artwork — register it. Each distinct creature design, each species variant, key animation frames. Copyright registration for visual art: ~$65 per work (can batch similar works).

### Sound Design
The creature's sound palette — copyrightable as a sound recording and as a musical composition (if melodic).

## What's a Trade Secret

Some things are better kept secret than patented. Patents are public — you're trading disclosure for 20 years of protection. Trade secrets last forever if you keep them secret.

### Best kept as trade secrets:
- **The exact presence-field-to-behavior mapping tables** — how 30 dimensions map to specific creature animations. A competitor can't reverse-engineer this from watching the creature.
- **Species determination algorithm** — exactly how early interaction patterns crystallize into species. Observing from outside, you can't distinguish "emerged naturally" from "scripted."
- **Consolidation strategy** — how dream cycles decide what to prune, what to keep, what to compress. This is the creature's long-term memory quality.
- **The asking heuristics** — when to ask, how to modulate frequency, how to back off. This is the difference between "helpful pet" and "annoying nag."

### Protecting trade secrets:
- Document what IS a trade secret (create a register)
- Mark internal documents "CONFIDENTIAL — TRADE SECRET"
- Limit access (need-to-know basis)
- NDAs for anyone who sees the source (if you ever hire help or take investment)
- Don't post the mapping tables on GitHub

## Defensive Strategy

### Open Source vs Closed Source

**Recommendation: Hybrid.**

- **Open**: The cognitive core (UHMA engine). This is your moat, but it's also your credibility. "Yes, this really works — look at the code." Nobody else can replicate it because nobody else will write an AI system in assembly. Open-sourcing it PROVES the creature is real while being practically impossible to copy. The moat is skill, not secrecy.

- **Closed**: The creature translation layer, art, sound, species algorithms, behavior mappings. This is what makes it a PRODUCT. The engine is science. The creature is art. Keep the art closed.

- **Closed**: The mobile wrapper, JNI bridge, platform integration. This is commodity code but no reason to give it away.

### If Someone Copies You

Likely attack vectors:
1. **Clone the product with a scripted creature** — they can copy the look but not the brain. Your marketing: "feed them both the same thing, see which one actually learns." Side-by-side comparison destroys fakes.

2. **Port your open-source engine into their app** — if open-sourced under GPL/AGPL, they must open-source their derivative. If they don't, it's license violation. If open-sourced under MIT/Apache, they can use it freely — but they still can't copy the creature layer (closed + copyrighted + trade secret).

3. **Patent troll** — your provisional patent filing gives you prior art defense. Your git history with timestamps proves invention dates. Keep your git history clean and timestamped.

4. **Trademark squatter** — file in China/Japan before announcement. Period.

## Timeline

| When | Action | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| **Now** | Pick a product name. Search USPTO/CNIPA/JPO for conflicts. | Free (TESS, CNIPA search) |
| **This week** | File provisional patent on core invention (#1 above) | ~$300 USPTO |
| **Same week** | File trademark in US + China + Japan simultaneously | ~$1500-2000 total |
| **Before any public demo** | Register copyright on source code | ~$65 |
| **When art is done** | Register copyright on creature designs | ~$65 per batch |
| **Within 12 months of provisional** | Convert to full utility patent (or let it lapse) | ~$2000-5000 (or use patent attorney, ~$8000-15000) |
| **Before app store listing** | Freedom-to-operate search (confirm no blocking patents) | ~$3000-5000 with attorney |

Total defensive IP setup: roughly $5000-8000 if you do most of it yourself, $15000-25000 with full attorney support. For a product with $25M upside, this is negligible.

## The Real Moat

Patents expire. Trademarks can be challenged. Code can be copied.

The real moat is:
1. **Assembly** — nobody else will do this. The barrier is "learn to write a cognitive system in ARM assembly." That's not a weekend project.
2. **The holographic engine** — even if someone reads the code, understanding VSA well enough to modify or improve it is a tiny talent pool.
3. **Head start** — every day the creature learns, it gets harder to replicate. You can't copy months of holographic memory development.
4. **The community** — once people are raising creatures, sharing them, competing — that network effect is the real lock-in. Nobody switches when their creature has 6 months of personality.
