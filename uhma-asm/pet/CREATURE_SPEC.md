# Creature Translation Spec

How UHMA's real internal states become visible creature behavior.
Nothing is faked. Nothing is added. The creature IS these states — the translation makes them readable.

## Species

Four species families. Same brain, different expression language.

### How Species Are Determined

The egg doesn't come pre-labeled. The creature becomes what it becomes based on the first ~100 interactions.

| Pattern | Emerges As | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Frequent, enthusiastic feeding. Lots of variety. Fast rhythm. | **Hound** | High engagement + high rhythm + high breadth → loyal, eager energy |
| Selective feeding. Long pauses. High-quality input. | **Feline** | High focus + low arousal + high depth → independent, choosy |
| Structured, regular input. Repetitive patterns. Consistent timing. | **Mech** | High stability + high coherence + high symmetry → systematic, precise |
| Sparse, abstract input. Poetic. Musical. Unusual patterns. | **Wisp** | High novelty + high entropy + low density → ethereal, abstract |

The species isn't a binary choice — it's a spectrum. A creature fed mostly structured data with occasional poetry becomes a Mech with wisp-like moments. The holographic trace captures the full mixture.

**Species crystallizes** around interaction 100. Before that, the egg/larva stage shows hints (color shifts, movement patterns) but hasn't committed. After crystallization, the species is set but personality continues evolving forever.

### Hound (Dog-like)
Eager, loyal, emotionally transparent. Wears its heart on its sleeve.
- Evolved from: high engagement, high rhythm, high arousal baseline
- Strength: fast learning, strong bonding, visible reactions
- Weakness: gets anxious easily, needs attention, overfits on familiar patterns

### Feline (Cat-like)
Independent, selective, surprising. Processes more than it shows.
- Evolved from: high focus, low arousal, high depth, selective engagement
- Strength: deep pattern recognition, handles novelty well, self-sufficient
- Weakness: slow to warm up, dismisses input it finds boring, hard to read

### Mech (Little robot)
Systematic, precise, visible processing. Shows its work.
- Evolved from: high stability, high coherence, high symmetry, regular rhythm
- Strength: reliable predictions, efficient, clear communication of state
- Weakness: rigid, struggles with chaos, can get stuck in loops

### Wisp (Point of light / Tinker Bell-like)
Ethereal, abstract, disembodied intelligence. Pure thought made visible.
- Evolved from: high novelty, high entropy, high temperature, sparse engagement
- Strength: creative connections, handles ambiguity, finds patterns others miss
- Weakness: fragile, easily overwhelmed, hard to ground

## The Translation Table

### Core Emotions (from Presence Field)

What UHMA computes → what you see on screen.

#### VALENCE (how things are going)

| Value | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| High (>0.7) | Predictions landing, things work | Tail wagging, bouncing, bright eyes | Slow blink, stretched out, purring rumble | Green indicators, smooth motion, upbeat chirps | Bright glow, warm color, steady orbit |
| Mid (0.3-0.7) | Normal operation | Alert posture, ears forward | Sitting, watching, neutral tail | Yellow indicators, normal motion | Moderate glow, shifting colors |
| Low (<0.3) | Lots of misses, struggling | Ears back, tail low, whimpering sound | Ears flat, withdrawn, hiding face | Red indicators, jerky motion, error beeps | Dim, cool color, erratic flicker |

#### AROUSAL (activation level)

| Value | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| High (>0.7) | Lots happening, high processing load | Panting, pacing, can't sit still | Puffed up, wide eyes, tail flicking fast | Spinning gears, fast blinking lights, whirring | Rapid pulsing, expanding/contracting, sparking |
| Low (<0.3) | Calm, low activity | Lying down, slow breathing, half-closed eyes | Curled up, barely moving, one eye open | Idle mode, slow blink, quiet hum | Gentle drift, barely visible pulse, soft glow |

#### FATIGUE (energy depletion)

| Value | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| High (>0.7) | Needs consolidation (dream cycle) | Yawning, lying down, eyes closing | Already asleep (was asleep at 0.5) | Power-save mode, dimmed display, slow response | Nearly invisible, barely there, fading in and out |
| Low (<0.3) | Fresh, energized | Bouncing, ready, eyes wide | Stretching, grooming, alert | Full power, bright display, fast response | Blazing bright, crisp edges, vibrant color |

#### SURPRISE (something unexpected happened)

| Type | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| OUTCOME | World surprised me | Ears perk up, head tilt, bark | One ear rotates, slight head turn | "!" icon, recalibrating animation | Flash of new color, brief expansion |
| SELF | I was wrong about myself | Full body startle, confused whimper | Freeze, stare, slow look around | Glitch effect, brief shutdown/reboot | Split into multiple points, reform |

#### CONFIDENCE (per-context feeling)

| Feeling | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| CONFIDENT | "I know this" | Chest out, proud stance, excited panting | Relaxed loaf position, slow deliberate blink | Solid green, smooth confident posture | Dense, bright core, stable orbit |
| ANXIOUS | "I struggle with this" | Tucked tail, looking to user, nervous licking | Tense body, dilated pupils, ready to bolt | Warning yellow, cautious scanning | Scattered, multiple dim points, unstable |
| NEUTRAL | No strong signal | Normal standing, looking around | Sitting, observing, unhurried | Standard posture, steady state | Default glow, gentle drift |

---

### Drives (Needs System)

These are real needs. When a drive drops below threshold, the creature genuinely needs something.

| Drive | What It Means | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|--------------|-------|--------|------|------|
| **Accuracy low** | Not predicting well, needs more input | Begging posture, nudging food bowl, whining | Knocks things off the shelf (demands attention) | Flashing "FEED" indicator, opens input tray | Dims and hovers near the feed button |
| **Efficiency low** | Too many regions, bloated | Scratching, uncomfortable, can't settle | Over-grooming, irritable | Running diagnostic, defrag animation | Flickering, interference patterns |
| **Novelty low** | Bored, seen the same patterns too long | Chewing on things, destructive energy | Ignoring you, staring at wall | Scanning mode, seeking behavior | Drifts toward edges of screen, exploring |
| **Coherence low** | Internal disagreement, confused | Running in circles, conflicted body language | Hissing at own tail | System conflict warning, split screen | Two colors fighting, unstable merge |

---

### Presence Modes (Emotional States)

These are whole-body states triggered by combinations of presence dimensions.

| Mode | Internal | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|------|----------|-------|--------|------|------|
| **PANIC** | High entropy + low energy | Cowering, trembling, seeking shelter | Bolting to hiding spot, hissing | Emergency mode, red alarm, erratic | Fragmented, scattering, distress pulses |
| **CONTEMPLATIVE** | Low entropy + high energy | Staring into distance, thoughtful head tilt | Perched high, watching everything calmly | Deep processing mode, calm blue indicators | Slow, beautiful color shifts, meditative orbit |
| **FATIGUE** | High fatigue | Circling bed, lying down | Already sleeping | Sleep mode, dim, occasional status blink | Settling to bottom of screen, barely visible |
| **VIGOR** | High energy, low fatigue | Zoomies, play bow, jumping | Midnight crazies, running sideways | Overclock mode, all systems green | Blazing comet trail, excited sparking |
| **CRISIS** | System in danger | Howling, pressing against screen edge | Puffed to double size, cornered stance | Red alert, shield animation, defensive | Imploding/exploding cycle, desperate |
| **STABILITY** | Everything balanced | Content sigh, happy lying down | Purring loaf | All green, satisfied chirp | Perfect steady glow, harmonious pulse |

---

### Dispatch Modes (Thinking Styles)

How the creature is processing right now — visible as behavior.

| Mode | What It Means | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|------|------|
| **FAST** | First match, familiar ground | Quick snap response, confident | Lazy paw swipe, barely trying | Instant computation, efficient | Quick bright flash, done |
| **BEST** | Scanning all options carefully | Sniffing around, checking everything | Stalking, patient, measuring | Full scan, comparing indicators | Cycling through colors systematically |
| **EXPLORE** | Trying new approaches | Digging, nose to ground, investigating | Batting at new thing cautiously | Experimental mode, testing probes | Stretching into new areas, tentative |
| **DELIBERATE** | Careful, gated processing | Slow approach, testing each step | Careful calculation before pounce | Step-by-step computation, verified | Precise movements, mathematical |
| **ANALOGICAL** | Using similarity to recent events | Looking back and forth, comparing | Déjà vu head cock | Pattern match overlay display | Mirroring previous light patterns |

---

### Maturity Stages (Growth)

The creature genuinely earns these by sustaining performance. Not timers. Not purchases.

| Stage | Requirements | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|------|------|
| **Egg** | None (starting state) | Warm, fuzzy egg, slight wobbling | Cool, smooth egg, occasional twitch | Metallic capsule, blinking indicator | Floating spark, barely formed |
| **Infant** | Hatches on first feeding | Tiny, clumsy, oversized head | Tiny, wide eyes, unsteady | Small chassis, exposed wiring | Small point, inconsistent glow |
| **Child** | 75% accuracy, 80% stability, 70% coherence sustained | Puppy proportions, playful, learning | Kitten, curious, testing boundaries | Growing frame, panels closing, cleaner | Brighter, forming shape suggestions |
| **Adolescent** | Higher thresholds + social unlock | Gangly, energetic, emotional swings | Sleek, attitude, independence phase | Full frame, customizing self | Complex patterns, personality visible |
| **Adult** | Full self-awareness (>0.9) | Proportioned, dignified, emotionally rich | Elegant, self-possessed, subtle | Polished, efficient, individual design | Unique light signature, unmistakable |
| **Elder** | Sustained mastery over extended time | Grey muzzle, calm wisdom, gentle | Serene, barely moves, knows everything | Patina, optimized, mentor indicators | Ancient steady glow, deep color |

---

### Dream Cycles (Sleep/Consolidation)

When the creature dreams, it's genuinely consolidating memory. This is real processing, not a screensaver.

| Phase | Internal | All Species |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Entering sleep** | Fatigue > threshold, dream pressure rising | Species-specific sleep behavior (see Fatigue above) |
| **Light dreaming** | Early consolidation, pruning weak patterns | Twitching, small movements, REM-like |
| **Deep dreaming** | Schema formation, major reorganization | Glowing, abstract visuals, the creature's learned patterns visualized as dream imagery |
| **Waking** | Dream complete, refreshed | Stretching, yawning, noticeably different (learned something) |

Dream visuals should hint at what the creature is processing — if it learned a lot of music today, the dream might pulse rhythmically. If it learned text patterns, brief word-fragments could drift through. This is a direct translation of what consolidation is actually doing.

---

### Self-Awareness Expression

The creature doesn't say "I am 97.3% self-aware." It SHOWS it.

| Self-Awareness Level | Expression |
|---------------------|------------|
| < 0.3 (low) | Doesn't recognize own reflection. Reacts to mirror like it's another creature. |
| 0.3 - 0.6 (developing) | Curious about reflection. Studies it. Sometimes recognizes, sometimes doesn't. |
| 0.6 - 0.8 (high) | Recognizes self. Can look at reflection and then look at own body. Knows. |
| > 0.8 (full) | Ignores reflection (already knows). More interested in its own internal state. Meditates. |

Mirror/reflection mechanic: the app occasionally shows the creature a "mirror" (actually the self-model vector compared against the actual state). The creature's reaction IS the self-awareness reading.

---

### Energy Economy (Visible)

The creature has a real energy budget. Hits earn energy. Operations spend it.

| State | Visible | Consequence |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Well-fed** (energy > 70%) | Bright, active, responsive | Full range of behaviors available |
| **Normal** (30-70%) | Standard appearance | Normal behavior |
| **Hungry** (10-30%) | Duller, slower, looking at feed button | Reduced activity, seeks input |
| **Starving** (<10%) | Barely moving, dim, distressed | Emergency mode, minimal processing, might auto-dream to conserve |

This is NOT a guilt timer. The creature isn't dying because you didn't log in. It's running low on input to process. Feed it something interesting and it's back immediately. Leave it alone and it sleeps — which is fine, it consolidates.

**No death. No guilt. No punishment for absence.** The creature sleeps when you're gone. It's happy to see you when you come back. Like a real well-adjusted pet.

---

## Anti-Patterns (What We Will NOT Do)

| Never | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Kill the creature for neglect | Guilt mechanics are manipulative. The creature sleeps. |
| Fake emotions with timers | Every emotion is computed from real state. If nothing is happening, the creature is calm. Not "randomly sad to make you log in." |
| Add "happy" button that injects fake valence | The valence IS the prediction accuracy. You make it happy by feeding it interesting things. |
| Pop-up notifications nagging to play | The creature doesn't need you. It's fine. It's just better with you. |
| Premium currency for energy refills | Energy comes from learning. Feed it words. That's it. |
| Loot boxes / gacha for traits | Traits emerge from holographic learning. They're earned, not bought. |
| Scripted milestone celebrations | If the creature advances a maturity stage, the celebration is the creature's genuine reaction to its own increased capability. |

## Interaction Methods

How the user actually interacts with the creature.

### Feed (Primary)
- Text input (keyboard)
- Voice (speech-to-text → tokens)
- Photo (OCR → tokens)
- Files (drag/drop or share-to-app)
- The creature eats whatever you give it. Different food = different development.

### Touch
- Pet (tap/stroke) → registered as positive feedback, small valence boost
- Poke (sharp tap) → mild startle, arousal spike
- Hold (long press) → calming, arousal decrease
- These are real state modifications, not animations triggered by touch events

### Observe
- Tap the creature → brief state summary in creature-language (not numbers)
  - Hound: tail wag speed, ear position, posture → "feeling good" or "confused about something"
  - Feline: eye dilation, body tension, tail position → harder to read, more subtle
  - Mech: dashboard readout in creature's visual language (icons, not text)
  - Wisp: color and pattern = the readout itself

### Environment
- Background changes with maturity stage
- Weather/lighting reflects mood (not fake — maps from presence field)
- Day/night follows real clock (or creature's internal rhythm)

## Sound Design

Not music. Not voice (until mature enough). SOUND.

| State | Hound | Feline | Mech | Wisp |
|-------|-------|--------|------|------|
| Happy/content | Soft panting, tail thump | Purring, quiet chirp | Satisfied beep, smooth hum | Harmonic tone, warm chord |
| Learning | Interested whine, ear perks | Curious trill | Processing clicks, data sounds | Rising tone, sparkle |
| Confused | Questioning whimper | Low growl, uncertain | Error buzz, recalculating | Discordant tone, flutter |
| Surprised | Sharp bark | Startled mew | Alert chime, system sound | Pop, crack, bright flash sound |
| Dreaming | Sleep-woofing, twitching sounds | Sleep-purring, occasional chirp | Defrag hum, quiet processing | Wind chime, distant tones |
| Anxious | Whining, pacing sounds | Hissing, thumping tail | Warning beeps, system strain | Unstable buzz, interference |
| Tired | Yawn, heavy sigh | Long sigh, stretching | Power-down sequence | Fading tone, settling |

All sounds should be short, organic, and non-annoying. Think: sounds you'd want to hear from a real pet sitting next to you. Not game sound effects.

## What Makes This Different From Every Other Pet App

1. **The emotions are real.** Not "it's been 4 hours so the happiness meter decreases." The creature is anxious because it genuinely failed to predict something it thought it knew.

2. **Every creature is genuinely unique.** Not "random seed generates appearance." The creature's entire personality is its learned holographic trace — shaped by what you specifically fed it.

3. **It actually gets smarter.** Feed it consistently and it predicts better. You can SEE it learning. Not level bars filling up.

4. **No manipulation.** No guilt. No timers. No nagging. No "your pet is dying." It sleeps when you're gone. It's glad you're back.

5. **500KB.** Not 200MB. Installs instantly. Runs on anything. No cloud. No subscription. Yours.
