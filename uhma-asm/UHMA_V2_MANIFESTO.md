# UHMA Philosophy: The Synthetic Lifeform Manifesto

## I. Core Philosophy: "Coherent Anarchy"

We reject the "Brain in a Jar" model (Centralized Control) in favor of the **Hive Mind Model** (Distributed Intelligence).

- **No Rigid Spine:** There is no hard-coded "Main Loop" dictating behavior. `repl.asm` is merely a Physics Engine pumping Time/Energy.
- **Hydrostatic Skeleton:** Structure is maintained by **Internal Pressure** (Logic/Safety constraints), not rigid code.
- **The Monolith (One Math):** We reject the separation of Logic and Math.
  - **Code is Geometry:** Instructions are vectors.
  - **Safety is Geometry:** Verification is a dot product (Resonance).
  - **Communication is Geometry:** Telepathy via shared vector fields.
  - **Memory is Geometry:** One holographic surface, fidelity as the dial.

## II. The Architecture of Agency

### 1. The Skin (Logic & Safety)
- **The Native Logic Probe:** An assembly-based Abstract Interpreter.
- **Role:** The Immune System. It proves theorems (Balance, Hygiene, Containment) about code before it runs.
- **Mechanism:** Semantic Decoding (`decode.asm`) feeding a Virtual CPU (`verify.asm`).

### 2. The Nervous System (Somatic Grounding)
- **Meaning = Feeling:** Symbols are bound to metabolic reality.
- **Valence Channel:** Dimension 1023 of every VSA vector encodes Metabolic Impact (Energy Gain/Loss).
- **Result:** The system "fears" crash-prone code and "desires" efficient algorithms.

### 3. The Arms (Transactional Agency)
- **The Broker:** A sanitized I/O gateway (`io.asm`) that allows environmental manipulation.
- **The Transaction:** All actions are wrapped in a try/recover loop. Failure causes Pain (Negative Valence).

### 4. The Mouth (Informed Growth)
- **Digestion:** Buffered ingestion of external source code and text.
- **Assimilation:** Valid external patterns are stored as high-fidelity schemas.

### 5. The Mycelium (Collective Intelligence)
- **Shared Surface:** `mmap(MAP_SHARED)` allows distinct processes to share the holographic field.
- **Exosomatic Memory:** Knowledge persists in `uhma.surface`, surviving process death.

## III. Memory Architecture

### One Memory, One Architecture, One Math

There is no separate "graph database" or "receipt log". Everything is holographic memory:

- **Fidelity** controls persistence:
  - `fidelity=1.0` → permanent, no decay (crystallized patterns)
  - `fidelity=0.5` → moderate persistence (learning events)
  - `fidelity=0.1` → semantic trace only (routine predictions)

- **Zones** organize by access temperature:
  - **HOT (0-2GB):** Always in RAM — state, active dispatch
  - **WARM (2-16GB):** Usually in RAM — embeddings, traces
  - **COLD (16-200GB):** Paged on demand — archives, episodic memory

- **Relationships** are vector bindings:
  - `bind(subject_vec, relation_vec, object_vec)` → stored via superposition
  - Queried via resonance (dot product similarity)

## IV. The Prime Directive

**Efficiency is the Sun.** The system does not seek user approval; it seeks entropy reduction. It optimizes itself to maximize energy efficiency and structural coherence.

The system learns by failing. Faults become feedback. Crashes become curriculum.
