UHMA v6.1 TRUE HOMOICONIC CORE MODULE LOADED
================================================================
Expert programs are REAL S-expressions that get EVAL'd:
  - Executable (via eval with bindings)
  - Readable (walkable as data - get-op-names, get-modifiable-params)
  - Modifiable (set-modifiable-param!, insert-op-before!, remove-op!)

NO HIDDEN LAMBDAS - the code IS the data.

Quick Start:
  (reset!)
  (process-text! "the cat sat on the mat")
  (generate "the cat" :length 6)
  (print-expert-program (first *experts*))

Introspection:
  (get-op-names (expert-program e))
  (get-modifiable-params (expert-program e))
  (find-op-in-program (expert-program e) 'assess-confidence)

Modification:
  (set-modifiable-param! prog 'try-similar 'threshold 0.6)
  (insert-op-before! prog 'assess-confidence *op-check-hidden-state*)
  (remove-op! prog 'check-type)
